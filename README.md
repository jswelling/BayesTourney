# BayesTourney

This project features a program to collect information about individual bouts in a tournament,
to figure out the relative strengths of the the participants.
It works by taking the record of wins and losses for the tournament and using Metropolis Monte Carlo
to estimate the over-and-under odds for every pair of players based on those wins and losses.
