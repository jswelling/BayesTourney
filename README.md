# LordBayesTourney

This project features a program to collect information about individual bouts in a tournament,
and then to use Metropolis Monte Carlo to figure out the relative strengths of the the participants.
Sadly, it's not really Bayesian, because so far I haven't been able to figure out the form of the
analytical prior distribution.
