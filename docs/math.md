A description of the math goes here.

 {% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
 {% endraw %}

$$E=mc^2$$

$$$
P_{ki}=\frac{w_k}{w_k + w_i}
$$$

$$$
P_k \propto \prod _{i\neq k} \left ( \frac{w_k}{w_k + w_i} \right )^{\alpha_{ki}}\left ( \frac{w_i}{w_k + w_i} \right )^{\beta_{ki}}
$$$

Is this even updating?
